_<Rocket class="size-3 inline" /> Thrilled to announce 'changelog'!_

Changelog is a lightweight, free and open source template for your changes. We utilize open source technologies such as <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a> and leverage Astro's content collections. The initial template allows you to write markdown and use them as a CMS. We focus on readability/usability first and all the pretty things follow. P.S. thank you <a href="https://www.untitledui.com/free-icons" target="_blank">Untitled UI</a> for providing the beautiful icon set!
